I am a second-year data science master student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also a research assistant in the [Tan Lab](http://tanlab4generegulation.org/) with _Prof. Kai Tan_ at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia. In addition, I am currently working on a marketing project with _Prof. Raghuram Iyengar_ and _Prof. Young-Hoon Park_. 

My research focus lies in the domain of machine learning and data science. In particular, I am interested in implementing and developing neural networks to address biomedical and practical problems.   

Before joining University of Pennsylvania, I complete my Bachelor of Science degree in applied mathematics at Case Western Reserve University under the supervision of _Prof. Mark Meckes_ and _Prof. Daniela Calvetti_.
