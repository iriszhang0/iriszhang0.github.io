I am a second-year data science master student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am also a research assistant in the [Tan Lab] (http://tanlab4generegulation.org/) with Prof. Kai Tan at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia. In addition, I am currently working on a marketing project with Prof. Raghuram Iyengar and Prof. Young-Hoon Park. 

My research focus lies in the domain of machine learning and data science. In particular, I am interested in implementing and developing neural networks to address biomedical and practical problems.   

Before joining University of Pennsylvania, I complete my Bachelor of Science degree in applied mathematics at Case Western Reserve University under the supervision of Prof. Mark Meckes and Prof. Daniela Calvetti.
